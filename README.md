# coupled-rlc-circuits
An experimental project that studies the behavior of RLC circuits as harmonic oscillators as part of a lab module in Spanish. We study capacitive coupling in the time and frequency domains to study resonance. We also study a RL-diode circuit using chaos theory.

The files are the following:

RLC circuit:
- "1_data.xlsx":  Empirical data taken manually of a simple RLC circuit varying different parameters
- "1_Amplitude.py": Amplitude of output signal as a function of the input frequency. Empirical data vs theory
- "1_Frequency.py": Resonance frequency varying the inductance L. Empirical data vs theory.
- "1_Phase.py":     Phase difference between input and output signals as a function of the input frequency. Empirical data vs theory.

Work in progress to order the rest of the files.
